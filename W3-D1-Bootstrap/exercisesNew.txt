ASSIGNMENT TOPIC 
You are creating a website to showcase your favourite albums.
In this page you'd like to have a short bio of yourself, the top albums of your life, 
the worst album you ever listen to and everything related to the music you love.

IMPORTANT:
Start from the previous Musical assignment project you've created on M2-D2

NOTE:
Most of the time, even the most expert designers, need inspiration.
Spend some time surfing the web searching for the way of representing the albums that you like the most.
Could be the Amazon way, the Spotify or Apple music way or some other blog out there.
